# ChatGPT-Writing
Hi there! Occasionally I take a crack at ChatGPT and try to get it to stop writing shallow and uninteresting stories. I personally use a clone of the repo and write in Obsidian, but feel free to use Github's md reading or other tools!

Note: The prompts I give GPT are just thrown together to give it something to work with, they're not meant to be taken too seriously.

### How To Contribute
Interested in helping out? Great! Here's what you need to do:

- Fork the repo, and make a pull request with your research notes in a seperate folder.

- Research notes need to be .md
- Include as much of the (relevant) text data as you can, such as:
  - The entire prompt you gave GPT.
  - What it gave back to you.
  - Any interactions after that.
  - A separate summary of events would be great, but is not necessary.
- You can totally use your own prompts, just don't be inappropriate or anything, or your pull request will not be accepted.

I also plan on cleaning up the structure of any of my own future research notes!
