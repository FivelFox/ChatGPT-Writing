# ChatGPT-Writing
Hi there! Ocassionally I take a crack at ChatGPT and try to get it to stop writing shallow and uninteresting stories. I think I will be getting help from a friend as well.

The prompts I give GPT are just hobbled together to give it something to work with, they're not meant to be taken too seriously.
