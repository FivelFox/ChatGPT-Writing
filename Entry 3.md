I'm taking another shot at getting ChatGPT to write better stories. 

I gave it Prompt V1, and it spit out:

Chapter 1

Jack woke up to his alarm buzzing. He groggily turned it off and sat up in his bed. His small room was cluttered with tech gadgets and cables. He rubbed his eyes and slid his glasses on. He let out a small sigh as he realized he had to face another day of school. He got dressed and headed downstairs to the kitchen where his mom was making breakfast.

"Good morning, Jack," his mom greeted him with a smile.

"Morning," he mumbled back.

He sat down at the table and began eating his breakfast in silence. His mom noticed his lack of enthusiasm.

"Is everything okay, Jack?" she asked.

Jack hesitated before speaking, "I don't know. I just don't like school."

His mom placed a hand on his shoulder, "It'll be okay. You have your friends to support you, and remember that God is always with you."

Jack nodded and finished his breakfast. He grabbed his backpack and headed out the door.

Chapter 2

As Jack walked to school, he couldn't help but feel anxious. He didn't like being around so many people, and he didn't like the attention he sometimes got because of his stutter. He arrived at school and headed to his locker, where Brad was waiting for him.

"Yo, Jack!" Brad greeted him with a smile.

Jack smiled back and opened his locker.

"Did you finish the coding project we started yesterday?" Jack asked.

"Yep! It's all ready to go," Brad replied.

The two of them headed to their first class. Jack kept his head down, trying to avoid any unwanted attention. As they entered the classroom, Lily waved at them from her desk. Jack's heart fluttered a bit, and he gave a small wave back.

Chapter 3

The day went on as usual. Jack and his friends attended their classes, ate lunch together, and chatted about their hobbies. Jack felt a bit more comfortable around his friends, but he still couldn't shake off his anxiety.

As the day ended, Jack walked home with Brad.

"You okay, man? You've been quiet all day," Brad said.

"Yeah, I'm fine. Just not feeling great," Jack replied.

Brad placed a hand on Jack's shoulder, "If you ever need to talk, you know I'm here for you, right?"

Jack smiled, "Thanks, Brad. That means a lot."

Chapter 4

Over the next few days, Jack tried his best to push through his anxiety. He spent more time with his friends, and he even struck up a conversation with Lily about her artwork. However, his anxiety still lingered, and he didn't know how to get rid of it.

One afternoon, Jack was working on a new coding project when his mom entered his room.

"Jack, do you want to come to church with us tonight?" she asked.

Jack hesitated before replying, "I don't know. I don't feel like going out tonight."

His mom sat down on his bed, "I understand, but going to church might help you feel better. You'll be surrounded by people who love and care for you, and you'll be able to focus on God's love."

Jack thought about it for a moment before nodding, "Okay, I'll come."

Chapter 5

As they arrived at the church, Jack felt a bit nervous. He didn't like being in large groups of people, especially when it came to socializing. However, as the service began, Jack started to feel a sense of calm wash over him. The pastor spoke about God's love and how it can heal even the deepest wounds. Jack listened intently, feeling as though the pastor was speaking directly to him.
