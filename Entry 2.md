Now we're talking! Been seeing some great improvements to ChatGPTs writing capabilities. I'm hoping I can get it to write 

There also seems to still be issues with it wanting to revert back to shallow writing, and there are weird cutoff points. I'll have to ask if it has a character limit for it's messages.

Update | It does have a 4070 character limit. Supposedly it can send messages consecutively to make up for it, but it seems like the writing prompt is too complex for it. I'll need to figure out how to chunk the prompts effectively.
