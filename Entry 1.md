I was messing around with [ChatGPT](obsidian://open?vault=Obsidian&file=ChatGPT%20Writing%20Prompt%20V1)earlier, trying to get it to write something other than shallow "and suddenly!" stories. I was actually making progress, it was starting to show more and tell a little less, there was even a particular sentience or two I thought was really good.

Aaaand then the immersion is broken and it goes back to telling an entire story on one page lol, just painting the story in huge strokes. I need to figure out how to make it write a much longer story, and I really need to figure out how to get it to drop telling and story brushing.
